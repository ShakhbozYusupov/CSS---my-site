# CSS---my-site
The website where I tested my CSS3 skills by creating a page that contains my skills, personal info and so on.
I am creating a personal website  using the skills I have learnt from the complete web development course by Angela Yu
I am also adding details about my background, interests and skills to this website so that it has more content. I am trying to focus more on its design since it is going to be a personal website of a web designer.
